# EVE_2024NASA_Challenge_MagicSpace_Team



The project is based on the use of data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nstedAPI/nph-nstedAPI? to analyze candidates for exoplanet status, aiming to predict their ability to support life and the presence of water. The code extracts data about these candidate exoplanets through the NASA API, processes it into a DataFrame, and displays the first few rows of the data. It normalizes various characteristics of the candidates, calculates new parameters, such as the product of orbital periods and stellar insolation, and adds binary indicators for the possibility of life based on temperature. Furthermore, the project includes the creation of a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm, which is trained on balanced data using the SMOTE method to improve predictions. The results indicate that some candidates, such as K07849.01 and K03395.02, have high chances of habitability, while others, like K07106.01, are not suitable for life. Additionally, the project predicts the probability of water presence on the candidate exoplanets, with K07849.01 showing the highest probability (0.60), followed closely by K07106.01 (0.58), indicating their potential to support life. Overall, the project demonstrates how NASA data can be utilized to analyze candidate exoplanets and predict their suitability for life, as well as the presence of water, which is a key factor for future research and colonization of other planets.
